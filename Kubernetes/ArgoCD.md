Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It automates the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that the desired application state defined in Git repositories matches the live state in the cluster. Argo CD monitors Git repositories for changes and synchronizes these changes to the Kubernetes environment, providing real-time visibility and control over application deployment. It supports multiple deployment strategies, rollback capabilities, and integrates with various CI/CD tools. By using Argo CD, organizations can achieve consistent and reliable application delivery, improve deployment security, and streamline the continuous deployment process in Kubernetes environments.
