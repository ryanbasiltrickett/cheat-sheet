Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and fully managed database service designed to run Cassandra workloads in the AWS cloud. It allows users to manage and operate Cassandra databases without the need to provision, configure, or maintain underlying infrastructure. Keyspaces supports the same Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and Cassandra drivers, enabling users to easily migrate and run their existing Cassandra applications with little or no changes. It offers features like on-demand and provisioned capacity modes, automated backups, encryption at rest, and multi-region replication, ensuring high availability, security, and reliability for critical applications. Keyspaces is ideal for use cases such as IoT data management, messaging, time-series data, and real-time analytics.
