Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully managed service that simplifies setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud. It supports multiple database engines, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. RDS automates tasks like provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling, allowing users to focus on their applications. It offers high availability through Multi-AZ deployments, automated backups, encryption for security, and seamless integration with other AWS services. RDS is ideal for web applications, enterprise applications, and any workload requiring a relational database.
