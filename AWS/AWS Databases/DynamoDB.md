Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is designed to handle large volumes of data with low latency, making it ideal for applications that require high throughput and consistent performance, such as web apps, mobile backends, gaming, IoT, and more. DynamoDB supports key-value and document data models, offering flexible schema design. It automatically scales to adjust for capacity and maintains performance during traffic spikes. Additional features include built-in security, backup and restore, in-memory caching with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), and multi-region replication for high availability and disaster recovery.
