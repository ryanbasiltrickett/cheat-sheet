AWS Batch is a cloud service that simplifies the process of running batch computing workloads on AWS. It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources based on the requirements of the batch jobs. Users can easily define, schedule, and execute batch computing jobs, allowing for efficient and cost-effective processing of large-scale computational tasks, such as data processing, analytics, and machine learning training, without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
