AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It records API calls made on your account, capturing information such as the identity of the caller, the time of the call, the request parameters, and the response elements. This data is stored in log files, which can be analyzed to track changes, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory standards. CloudTrail provides a comprehensive history of AWS API calls, helping you to monitor activity, detect unauthorized access, and maintain the security and integrity of your AWS environment.
