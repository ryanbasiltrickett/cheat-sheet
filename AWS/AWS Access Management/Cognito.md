AWS Cognito is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that simplifies user authentication and user management for web and mobile applications. It offers user sign-up, sign-in, and access control features, as well as support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and federated identities through integration with social identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, or enterprise identity providers using SAML. Cognito provides scalable and secure user directory management and integrates with other AWS services for seamless application development. It also allows for the synchronization of user data across devices, enhancing the user experience by providing consistent access to application features and settings.
