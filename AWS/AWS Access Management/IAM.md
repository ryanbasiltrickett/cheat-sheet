AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows you to securely manage access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and assign permissions to them through policies that define what actions are allowed on which resources. IAM supports both AWS Management Console and API-based access, allowing fine-grained control over permissions. It integrates with other AWS services to enforce security best practices and compliance requirements, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls. IAM helps ensure that only authorized users and applications can access and interact with AWS resources, providing a key layer of security for your AWS environment.
