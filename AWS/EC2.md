Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is an AWS service offering resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Users can rent virtual servers, known as instances, to run applications. EC2 allows flexibility in scaling instances based on demand and offers full control over configurations, including choice of operating system, instance type, and security settings. It's widely used for hosting websites, running applications, and performing data analysis tasks in the cloud.
