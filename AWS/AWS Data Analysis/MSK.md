AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for users to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data. It provides managed clusters that are highly available, scalable, and secure, allowing users to focus on building applications without needing to manage the underlying Kafka infrastructure. MSK integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and supports popular Kafka APIs and tools, making it suitable for real-time data streaming, event sourcing, and log aggregation scenarios.
