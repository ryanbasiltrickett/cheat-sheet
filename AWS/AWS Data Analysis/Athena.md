AWS Athena is an interactive query service that enables users to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It requires no infrastructure setup and allows users to quickly query data stored in various formats such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, and more. Athena is serverless, automatically scales based on query complexity and data volume, and integrates seamlessly with AWS Glue for schema discovery and catalog management. It's ideal for ad-hoc querying and analyzing large-scale datasets stored in S3, offering cost-effective and efficient data analysis capabilities.
