AWS Textract is a managed machine learning service provided by Amazon Web Services that automatically extracts text, forms, and tables from scanned documents and images. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) by understanding the structure and layout of documents, allowing it to extract and organize data from forms, tables, and various document types with high accuracy. AWS Textract supports a range of use cases, such as digitizing paper forms, automating data entry, and processing invoices and receipts. The service is designed to integrate with other AWS tools and workflows, making it easier to incorporate document processing into applications and business processes. By using AWS Textract, organizations can streamline document management, reduce manual data entry, and enhance data accessibility and analysis.
