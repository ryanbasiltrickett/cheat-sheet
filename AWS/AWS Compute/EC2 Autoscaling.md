Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that automatically adjusts the number of Amazon [[EC2 Instances]] in response to changes in demand. It ensures that you have the right number of instances running to handle the load for your applications, scaling out to accommodate spikes in traffic and scaling in to save costs during low-traffic periods. EC2 Auto Scaling provides features like scheduled scaling, dynamic scaling, and predictive scaling, allowing you to optimize performance and cost. By using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, organizations can improve application availability, maintain performance, and manage costs efficiently by automatically scaling their infrastructure based on demand.
