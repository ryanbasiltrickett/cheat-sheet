AWS Service Catalog is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows organizations to create, manage, and distribute approved catalogues of IT services and resources. It enables IT administrators to define a catalogue of products, such as virtual machines, databases, and other AWS resources, that are pre-configured and standardized for use by end-users. AWS Service Catalog helps enforce governance and compliance by allowing administrators to control and manage the configuration and deployment of resources. It provides tools for setting up portfolios of products, managing access permissions, and integrating with other AWS services like AWS [[CloudFormation]] for automated deployments. By using AWS Service Catalogue, organizations can streamline resource provisioning, ensure consistency, and maintain control over the AWS environment.
