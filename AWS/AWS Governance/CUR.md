The AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) is a comprehensive cost management service provided by Amazon Web Services that delivers detailed information about your AWS usage and costs. It provides a granular view of your AWS expenses, including cost allocation tags, resource IDs, and pricing details, enabling you to analyse and understand your spending patterns. The AWS CUR can be configured to generate reports hourly, daily, or monthly and can be stored in an Amazon [[S3]] bucket for easy access and integration with other analytics tools. By using AWS CUR, organizations can perform detailed cost analysis, optimize resource allocation, and ensure accurate chargebacks and financial reporting for their AWS resources.
