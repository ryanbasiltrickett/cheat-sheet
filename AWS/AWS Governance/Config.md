AWS Config is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors and records AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. AWS Config provides detailed insights into configuration changes and resource relationships, helping you maintain compliance with internal policies and external regulations. It integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS [[Systems Manager]] and AWS [[CloudTrail]], for comprehensive operational and security management. By using AWS Config, you can simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting across your AWS environment.
