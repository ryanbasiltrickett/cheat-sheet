AWS Proton is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that simplifies the deployment and management of containerized and serverless applications. It enables organizations to define and enforce standardized deployment patterns and infrastructure configurations for applications, making it easier to deploy and manage complex, microservices-based architectures. AWS Proton provides a centralized management console where you can create and manage templates for service infrastructure and application deployments. It integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS CodePipeline and AWS [[CloudFormation]], to automate the deployment process and ensure consistency across environments. By using AWS Proton, teams can reduce operational overhead, accelerate development cycles, and maintain best practices in application deployment and management.
