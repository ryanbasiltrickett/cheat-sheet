AWS Directory Service is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables you to set up and run Microsoft Active Directory (AD) in the AWS Cloud, or connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises AD. It offers multiple directory options, including AWS Managed Microsoft AD, AD Connector, and Simple AD, catering to different use cases and requirements. AWS Directory Service helps manage user accounts, groups, and access to network resources, simplifying the integration and management of AD-dependent applications and services. It supports seamless domain joining for Amazon [[EC2 Instances]], enabling single sign-on (SSO) for AWS applications, and integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management ([[IAM]]) for enhanced security. By using AWS Directory Service, organizations can leverage the scalability, availability, and security of the AWS Cloud while maintaining familiar AD functionality.
