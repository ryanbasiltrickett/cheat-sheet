AWS Trusted Advisor is a real-time online resource provided by Amazon Web Services that helps you optimize your AWS environment by providing best practice recommendations. It evaluates your AWS account using five categories: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. AWS Trusted Advisor offers actionable insights to help you reduce costs, improve system performance, enhance security, and increase fault tolerance. It provides a comprehensive dashboard where you can view recommendations, prioritize actions, and track your progress. Some checks are available to all AWS users, while full access to all checks requires a Business or Enterprise support plan. By using AWS Trusted Advisor, you can ensure your AWS environment follows best practices and operates efficiently.
