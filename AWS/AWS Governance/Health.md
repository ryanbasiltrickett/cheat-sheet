AWS Health is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that provides personalized and detailed information about the performance and availability of your AWS services and resources.

AWS Health APIs allow for programmatic access to detailed health information, enabling automation and integration with your monitoring systems. By using AWS Health, you can stay informed about potential issues, take proactive measures to mitigate impact, and ensure the reliability and performance of your AWS services.
