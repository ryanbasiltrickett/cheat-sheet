AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications using data from your own applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. It allows you to build event-driven architectures by routing events between different sources and targets, simplifying the process of decoupling applications. EventBridge automatically scales to handle the event traffic, and you pay only for the events you consume. With features like event filtering, schema discovery, and built-in integrations with AWS services, EventBridge enables you to create responsive, scalable, and reliable applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
