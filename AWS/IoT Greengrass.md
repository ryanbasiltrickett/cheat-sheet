AWS IoT Greengrass is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables you to run local compute, messaging, data caching, sync, and ML inference capabilities on connected devices securely. It extends AWS to edge devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. AWS IoT Greengrass supports running Lambda functions, Docker containers, and other application logic on devices. It also allows for secure communication between devices and with the cloud, simplifying the development and deployment of IoT applications. By using AWS IoT Greengrass, organizations can build robust, intelligent edge applications that can operate with intermittent connectivity and respond quickly to local events.
