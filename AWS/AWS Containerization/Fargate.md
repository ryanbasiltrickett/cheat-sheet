AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate removes the need to provision, configure, and manage servers, allowing you to focus on designing and running applications. With Fargate, you define your application requirements, and AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, automatically scaling and optimizing resources based on the demands of your containerized applications. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, ensuring secure and efficient operation. Fargate is ideal for running microservices, batch processing, and event-driven applications, offering a cost-effective, scalable, and low-maintenance solution for container orchestration.
