AWS EKS Anywhere and ECS Anywhere extend the capabilities of Amazon EKS and ECS to your on-premises infrastructure. EKS Anywhere allows you to create and manage Kubernetes clusters on your own hardware, providing the same Kubernetes experience as Amazon EKS, along with consistent tooling and operational practices. Similarly, ECS Anywhere lets you run Amazon ECS tasks on your on-premises servers, giving you a unified management experience across cloud and on-premises environments. Both services offer seamless integration with other AWS services, enabling hybrid deployments, enhancing flexibility, and simplifying operations while maintaining high security, scalability, and reliability standards.
