Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D) is a Kubernetes distribution used by Amazon EKS to create reliable and secure Kubernetes clusters. EKS-D provides the same versions of Kubernetes and its dependencies that are used in EKS, ensuring compatibility and consistency. This allows you to run Kubernetes on-premises or on other cloud providers with the same operational tooling and best practices as EKS. EKS-D includes security patches and updates, offering a stable and secure environment for running containerized applications. With EKS-D, you can achieve a consistent Kubernetes experience across hybrid and multi-cloud environments while benefiting from the robustness and reliability of Amazon's Kubernetes infrastructure.
