AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies running, managing, and scaling Docker containers on AWS. ECS allows you to deploy containerized applications using Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine. It integrates with various AWS services like IAM for security, CloudWatch for monitoring, and ECR for container image storage. ECS manages the scheduling and placement of containers across your cluster, ensuring high availability and reliability. It supports microservices and batch processing workloads, offering flexibility and control over your containerized applications with the ability to optimize resource utilization and reduce operational complexity.
