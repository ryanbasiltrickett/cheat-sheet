AWS Snowmobile is a large, secure shipping container designed for transferring exabytes of data to AWS. It is intended for massive-scale data migration projects, such as moving large datasets from data centers or storage facilities. The Snowmobile provides a high-capacity, ruggedized solution for securely transporting large volumes of data, with built-in encryption to ensure data security during transit. Once the Snowmobile arrives at the destination, data is loaded onto the device and shipped to AWS, where it is ingested into the cloud. This service is ideal for organizations needing to migrate extensive amounts of data efficiently and securely.
