AWS Snowball Edge is a rugged, portable data transfer and edge computing device designed for handling large-scale data migration and processing tasks. It offers significant storage capacity and built-in compute capabilities, enabling you to run applications and process data locally before transferring it to AWS. Snowball Edge is particularly suited for environments with limited or intermittent connectivity, providing secure, encrypted data transfer and integration with AWS services. It comes in two variants: one optimized for storage and one with additional compute power for running local applications and processing data at the edge.
