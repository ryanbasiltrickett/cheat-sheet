AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS) is a managed service that helps you plan and execute migration projects by providing insights into your on-premises data center. It automatically collects detailed information about your servers, including CPU, memory, disk usage, network dependencies, and application performance. This data helps you understand the workload dependencies and performance characteristics, enabling you to make informed decisions about migration strategies and resource allocation in AWS. AWS ADS supports agent-based and agentless data collection methods and integrates with AWS [[Migration Hub]] for a centralized view of your migration projects. By using AWS Application Discovery Service, you can simplify migration planning, reduce risks, and ensure a more efficient and effective migration process.
