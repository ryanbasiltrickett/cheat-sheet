AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) is a managed service that simplifies, expedites, and automates the process of migrating applications from physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure to AWS. It uses continuous, block-level replication to keep source servers in sync with AWS, minimizing downtime during migration. AWS MGN allows you to perform non-disruptive tests and automates the conversion of servers to run natively on AWS. The service supports various operating systems and integrates with other AWS services for post-migration optimization. By using AWS MGN, organizations can achieve faster, more reliable migrations, reduce operational risks, and streamline the transition of their applications to the AWS cloud.
