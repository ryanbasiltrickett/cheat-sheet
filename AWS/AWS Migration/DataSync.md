AWS DataSync is a managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services such as Amazon [[S3]], Amazon [[EFS]], and Amazon [[FSx]] for Windows File Server. DataSync automates the execution of data transfer tasks, managing the infrastructure and handling encryption, data validation, and transfer acceleration. It is designed to transfer data at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools, making it ideal for data migrations, recurring data processing workflows, and replicating data for continuity and analysis. By using AWS DataSync, organisations can streamline data transfer processes, reduce manual effort, and ensure secure and efficient data movement to and from the cloud.
