AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) is a managed service that helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. It supports migrations between different database platforms, including homogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Oracle) and heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Amazon Aurora). AWS DMS enables you to continuously replicate data with minimal downtime, ensuring seamless transitions. The service supports a wide range of database engines and integrates with other AWS services like AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) for schema transformation. By using AWS DMS, you can streamline the database migration process, reduce complexity, and ensure data integrity during the transition to AWS.
