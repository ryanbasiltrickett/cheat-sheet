AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a security service provided by Amazon Web Services that helps protect web applications from common web exploits and vulnerabilities. It allows users to create custom security rules to filter and monitor HTTP and HTTPS requests based on conditions such as IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings. AWS WAF can be used to block or allow specific traffic, protect against common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and manage bot traffic. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudFront, Application Load Balancer, and API Gateway, providing robust protection and flexibility in securing web applications.
