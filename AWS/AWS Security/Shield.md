AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service offered by Amazon Web Services. It safeguards applications running on AWS by detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks in real-time. AWS Shield comes in two tiers: Standard and Advanced. The Standard tier is automatically included at no extra cost and provides protection against common network and transport layer DDoS attacks. The Advanced tier offers enhanced protection for more sophisticated attacks, real-time visibility into incidents, 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT), and financial protections against DDoS-related scaling charges. AWS Shield ensures the availability and resilience of applications by minimizing downtime and latency during DDoS incidents.
