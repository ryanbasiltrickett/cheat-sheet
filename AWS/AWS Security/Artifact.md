AWS Artifact is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that offers on-demand access to AWS compliance reports and security and compliance documentation. It provides a centralized location for retrieving and managing compliance artifacts, such as audit reports, certifications, and agreements, which are essential for meeting regulatory and audit requirements. AWS Artifact includes two main features: Artifact Reports, which offer detailed reports on AWS compliance certifications, and Artifact Agreements, which facilitate access to AWSâ€™s Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and other agreements. By providing easy access to these documents, AWS Artifact helps organizations streamline their compliance management processes and demonstrate adherence to various standards and regulations.
