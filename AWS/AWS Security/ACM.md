AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a managed service by Amazon Web Services that simplifies the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates for securing network communications. ACM helps you easily request and renew public certificates from Amazon's Certificate Authority, or import your own certificates. It automates the process of certificate management, including renewal and deployment, and integrates seamlessly with AWS services such as Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon API Gateway. By using ACM, you can enhance the security of your applications by ensuring that data transmitted between clients and your services is encrypted and secure.
