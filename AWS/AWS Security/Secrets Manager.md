AWS Secrets Manager is a managed service by Amazon Web Services that helps protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources without the upfront cost and complexity of managing your own hardware security module (HSM) or infrastructure. It allows you to securely store, manage, and retrieve secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. Secrets Manager automates the rotation, auditing, and access control of secrets, ensuring they remain secure and up-to-date. The service integrates seamlessly with AWS services and can trigger lambda functions for custom rotation logic. By centralizing secret management, AWS Secrets Manager simplifies maintaining security best practices, reduces the risk of accidental exposure, and helps organizations comply with security and regulatory requirements.
