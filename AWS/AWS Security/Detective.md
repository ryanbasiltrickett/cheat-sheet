AWS Detective is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that simplifies the process of investigating and analysing security issues within your AWS environment. It automatically collects and analyses log data from various AWS services, such as AWS [[CloudTrail]] and Amazon [[VPC]] Flow Logs, to create a comprehensive security graph. This graph helps visualize and understand the relationships and activities of resources, users, and network traffic. AWS Detective uses machine learning and statistical analysis to identify anomalous behavior and potential security threats. By providing a unified view of security-related data and facilitating deeper investigations, AWS Detective helps organizations quickly identify, understand, and respond to security incidents.
