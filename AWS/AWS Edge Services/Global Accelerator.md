AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service provided by Amazon Web Services that improves the availability and performance of your applications with users around the world. It uses AWS's global network infrastructure to route traffic through the optimal paths, reducing latency and improving application responsiveness. Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that act as fixed entry points to your application endpoints in one or more AWS Regions, simplifying DNS management and improving failover capabilities. It continuously monitors the health of application endpoints and automatically redirects traffic to healthy endpoints in case of failures. By leveraging AWS Global Accelerator, you can enhance the performance, availability, and reliability of your global applications.
