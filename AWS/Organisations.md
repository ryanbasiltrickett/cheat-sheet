AWS Organizations is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that helps you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts within your organization. It enables you to create and manage groups of accounts, apply policies for governance, and simplify billing through consolidated invoicing. AWS Organizations provides policy-based management for controlling access and resources, enabling you to enforce compliance and security standards across all accounts. It supports Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict AWS service usage and integrate with AWS Identity and Access Management ([[IAM]]) for fine-grained access control. By using AWS Organizations, you can streamline account management, enhance security, and ensure consistent policy enforcement across your AWS environment.
