Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to create isolated sections of the AWS cloud where they can launch resources. VPC allows users to define their own virtual network environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, routing tables, and network gateways. It offers control over network security, allowing users to configure [[Security Groups]] and network access control lists ([[ACL]]) to restrict access to resources. VPC enables users to extend their on-premises data centers into the cloud securely and integrate with other AWS services seamlessly.

### Overview
#### Subnets
Subnets in AWS are segmented portions of an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, each assigned to a specific Availability Zone (AZ) within a region and IP address range. They help organize and manage resources within the VPC and control the flow of network traffic. By deploying resources across multiple subnets spanning different AZs, users can achieve high availability and fault tolerance. Subnets also enable the implementation of network security measures, such as [[Security Groups]] and network access control lists ([[ACL]]), to regulate traffic flow effectively.
#### Internet Gateways
Internet Gateways (IGWs) in AWS are components that facilitate communication between instances within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the internet. They serve as a gateway for internet-bound traffic and enable instances within the VPC to access the internet and be accessed from the internet. IGWs are attached to a VPC and provide a target for internet-routable traffic from instances within the VPC. They allow instances with public IP addresses to communicate directly with the internet, facilitating tasks like accessing websites, downloading software updates, and interacting with other internet-based services. IGWs play a crucial role in enabling connectivity between resources within a VPC and the broader internet while maintaining security through the use of security groups and network access control lists ([[ACL]]) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
#### Virtual Private Gateways
A Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) in AWS is a component that facilitates secure communication between an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and an on-premises network or another VPC. It acts as a VPN concentrator for establishing encrypted connections over the internet or [[AWS Direct Connect]]. VPGs are attached to a VPC and provide a gateway for traffic to and from the VPC. They enable secure connectivity between resources within the VPC and resources in remote networks, such as on-premises data centers or other VPCs. VPGs play a crucial role in extending network architectures and enabling hybrid cloud setups by establishing secure and reliable communication channels across different environments.
