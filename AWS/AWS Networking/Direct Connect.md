AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to establish private and dedicated network connections between their on-premises data centers and AWS cloud infrastructure. By bypassing the public internet, AWS Direct Connect offers a more reliable, secure, and consistent connection, with lower latency and higher bandwidth compared to internet-based connections. It allows organizations to extend their existing data center environments seamlessly into the AWS cloud, enabling hybrid cloud architectures and facilitating data transfer, large-scale migrations, and access to AWS services securely and efficiently.
