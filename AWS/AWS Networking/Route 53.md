AWS Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by Amazon Web Services. It routes end users to applications by translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses. Route 53 also provides health checking of resources and can route traffic to healthy endpoints or resources to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. It's widely used for domain registration, DNS routing, and load balancing within AWS and across the internet. Route 53 supports various DNS record types and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it a versatile and essential component of modern cloud architectures.
