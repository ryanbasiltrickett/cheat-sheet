AWS Outposts is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. It enables you to run AWS services locally, offering the same hardware infrastructure, services, and APIs as in the AWS cloud, ensuring a consistent hybrid experience. AWS Outposts supports workloads that require low latency, local data processing, and data residency, while providing seamless integration with the rest of AWS. By using AWS Outposts, organizations can benefit from a unified and consistent hybrid cloud environment, enabling workloads to run on-premises with the same flexibility, scalability, and security as the AWS cloud.
