AWS Transit Gateway simplifies network connectivity by allowing you to centrally manage and scale connectivity between [[VPC]]s, on-premises networks, and VPNs. It acts as a hub that enables seamless communication between thousands of VPCs across different AWS accounts and regions, as well as with on-premises data centers. With Transit Gateway, you can easily scale your network architecture without the complexity of managing individual peering connections. It supports both VPC and VPN attachments, providing a flexible and scalable solution for routing traffic across your network infrastructure. Additionally, Transit Gateway integrates with AWS services like [[Direct Connect]] and AWS Global Accelerator to further optimize network performance and resilience.
