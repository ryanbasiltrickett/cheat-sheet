Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality hosted on backend services such as AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or EC2 instances, as well as HTTP endpoints or web services hosted elsewhere. API Gateway supports various API types, including RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs, allowing developers to build real-time and event-driven architectures. It offers features such as traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring and logging, and built-in support for API versioning and documentation. With API Gateway, developers can easily create and deploy APIs without managing infrastructure, enabling them to focus on building scalable and reliable applications.
