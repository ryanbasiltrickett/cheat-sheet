VPN CloudHub is an AWS service that securely connects multiple remote networks to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ([[VPC]]) using encrypted VPN connections. It simplifies network connectivity by centralizing VPN management within AWS and supports dynamic routing protocols for efficient traffic routing. This service enables a hub-and-spoke architecture, allowing branch offices or data centers to securely communicate with each other and AWS resources over encrypted tunnels.
