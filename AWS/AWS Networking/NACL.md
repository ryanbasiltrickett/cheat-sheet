Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are sets of rules that govern the flow of traffic in and out of a network. In AWS, Network ACLs are associated with subnets within a Virtual Private Cloud ([[VPC]]), serving as a firewall at the subnet level. Users can define custom rules to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on criteria such as IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. These rules are evaluated in order, and the first matching rule determines whether the traffic is allowed or denied. Network ACLs provide an additional layer of security by allowing users to control traffic flow within their AWS VPCs according to their specific requirements.
