### Advanced Overview
#### S3 Replication
Objects can be replicated from one bucket to another, with both buckets needing to have versioning enabled. Existing objects need to be replicated manually, and deleting individual version will not be replicated by default.
#### S3 Object Locking
This can be used to ensure an object or an entire bucket isn't overwritten or deleted within a specific period, by means of the retention period or a legal hold.

Legal holds can be placed on objects by any user with the PutObjectLegalHold permission.
##### S3 Object Lock Modes
- Governance Mode
- Compliance Mode
##### Glacier Vault Lock
Allows for easy deployment and compliance enforcement for individual S3 Glacier vaults. A policy can be locked, but once locked the policy can not be changed.
#### S3 Presigned URLs
Allows temporary access to download or upload an object to s3 bucket, this means that this can be used for private buckets.
#### S3 Presigned Cookies
Allows access to access multiple restricted files in an s3 bucket, this means that this can be used for private buckets. The cookies will be stored on the user's computer and they can browse the private content.
